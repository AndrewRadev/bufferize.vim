## Usage

Execute `:Bufferize <command>` to run the given command and show its output in a temporary buffer. Examples of things you can try:

``` vim
:Bufferize messages
:Bufferize digraphs
:Bufferize map
```

You can then scroll or search through this buffer however you like.

*TODO: More features and documentation coming soon*
